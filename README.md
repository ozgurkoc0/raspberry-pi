## To get started you'll need

- **Raspberry Pi:** Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
- **Power Supply:** 5V/2.5A Adapter
- **SD Card:** 32GB
- **Display**
- **Peripherals:** Mouse, keyboard etc.

## Installation

Raspberry Pi needs an operating system to work: Raspberry Pi OS (previously called Raspbian).

- I installed the OS using the Raspberry Pi Imager.
- I downloaded and installed the Raspberry Pi Imager on my computer, inserted the 64GB SD card, and followed the instructions to write the OS to the card.


Once the OS was installed, I inserted the SD card into my Raspberry Pi, connected the peripherals, and powered it on.

## Keyboard Settings

To configure the keyboard layout on your Raspberry Pi, go to the **Preferences** -> **Raspberry Pi Configuration** -> **Localisation** -> **Keyboard**.
